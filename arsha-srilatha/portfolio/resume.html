              <li>
                Drove thorough manual testing and spearheaded detailed code
                reviews for the simulation of Human Machine Interface (HMI) UI
                in Train Control and Management System (TCMS), developed as an
                Angular SPA that aided the development team in identifying
                common areas of potential errors, contributing to the
                enhancement of the overall prototype development process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed multiple TCMS HMI UI simulations as prototypes for
                different train models catering to various categories of Train
                Crew, as web applications exceeding 200 pages each, utilizing
                Angular to efficiently reuse components and services that
                significantly minimized time, effort, and the occurrence of bugs
                and defects during the initial stages of development
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed the backend for UI Prototype Web Applications using
                Node.js, facilitating a comprehensive simulation of ground
                communication with trains, allowing for a thorough observation
                of the behaviour train crews might encounter during actual HMI
                usage. This aided in identifying necessary steps and
                interactions for responding to security alerts and messages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Utilized MS Visio to design additional screens for integration
                into TCMS HMI, incorporating insights from style guides, page
                navigation documents, and feedback received from both external
                and internal stakeholders, as well as the train crew, to create
                detailed picture models of the user interface.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conducted End-to-end(E2E) testing for the frontend of a mobile
                application designed for Train Crew use, developed using
                Test-Driven Development (TDD), and generated comprehensive test
                reports. Additionally, refined the React Native-based frontend
                by implementing edits based on test results and incorporating

            Throughout my academic journey, I achieved a commendable GPA of
            8.89. Engaging actively in extracurricular activities, I became a
            dedicated member of IEEE, contributing to a vibrant technical
            community. Additionally, I volunteered with the National Service
            Scheme, supporting elderly care initiatives and fostering compassion
            within the community. My passion for robotics led me to participate
            in a transformative workshop organized by IEEE, enhancing my
            practical skills. As a member of the College Dance Team, I not only
            won multiple national competitions but also managed logistics,
            ensuring the team's success. Furthermore, I organized a dance
            competition as part of Aagneya, a national cultural event,
            showcasing my leadership and persuasive skills. Overall, my college
            journey was enriched by diverse experiences, nurturing technical
            skills, community engagement, and leadership capabilities, which I
            am eager to bring to future endeavors.
